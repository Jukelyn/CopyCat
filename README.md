# CopyCat
CopyCat is a program that will simply repeat what you say until the end of time (or your battery is drained), nothing too impressive, just a small project I wanted to work on to brush up on my Tkinter skills.

<hr/>
Usage:
<ul>
  <li>Everybody (with Python): run <code>python src/copycat.py</code> command (asuming your in the CopyCat directory). Or just double click the py file.</li>
  <li>Mac: Launch the copycat.command</li>
</ul>

The <code>copycat.command</code> file is just a copy of the <code>copycat.py</code> file but I chmoded it to be executable and the shebang tells the system to use the python3 interpretor (if for some reason you need to change this, then do so yourself, honestly more work than just running the python command to run the file from the command-line). If you don't trust, just don't use it lol.

Tested OS: <br>
macOS 13.5.2 (22G91) -- works as expected, cool.<br>
Windows 11 Pro Version 23H2 10.0.22631 Build 22631 -- works as expected, cool x2.<br>
Linux (not tested) -- probably works but stop using linux with GUIs, smh.<br>
