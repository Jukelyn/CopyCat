# CopyCat
CopyCat is a program that will simply repeat what you say until the end of time (or your battery is drained), nothing too impressive, just a small project I wanted to work on to brush up on my Tkinter skills.

<hr/>
Usage:<br>
Everybody (with Python): run <code>python src/copycat.py</code> command (asuming your in the CopyCat directory). Or just double click the py file.

Tested OS:<br>
macOS 13.5.2 (22G91) -- works as expected, cool.<br>
Windows 11 Pro Version 23H2 10.0.22631 Build 22631 -- works as expected, cool x2.<br>
Linux (not tested) -- probably works but stop using linux with GUIs, smh.<br>
