# CopyCat
CopyCat is a program that will simply repeat what you say until the end of time (or your battery is drained), nothing too impressive, just a small project I wanted to work on to brush up on my Tkinter skills.

# Usage
Everybody (with Python): run `python src/copycat.py` command (asuming your in the CopyCat directory). Or just double click the py file.
